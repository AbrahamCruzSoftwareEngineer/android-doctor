# AndroidDoctor Documentation

This directory contains high-level documentation that guides the overall direction
and architecture of AndroidDoctor.

Planned documents include:

- **ROADMAP.md** — phased milestones and development plan
- **VISION.md** — guiding principles, philosophy, goals
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — high-level system architecture and module responsibilities
- **REPORT_SCHEMA.md** — structure of the future `report.json` collector output

These files will evolve significantly as AndroidDoctor progresses from planning to implementation.
