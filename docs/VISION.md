# AndroidDoctor Vision

AndroidDoctor exists to help Android teams **modernize safely and ship faster**.

Modern Android development is powerful, but teams often struggle with:
- Slow builds caused by tech debt
- Fear and uncertainty around Compose migration
- Outdated Gradle or Kotlin setups
- Inconsistent modernization strategies across teams

AndroidDoctor acts like a **diagnostic doctor** for Android projects:
- Identifies symptoms
- Explains causes
- Suggests safe, incremental treatments
- Empowers teams with clarity

## Core Principles

### 🩺 1. Advisory, Not Enforcing
AndroidDoctor never blocks builds or rewrites code.
It provides insights, recommendations, and clarity — not mandates.

### 🔍 2. Deterministic First
All core findings must come from deterministic signals such as:
- Gradle config
- Module structure
- Build features
- Tooling versions
- kapt usage

This ensures trust, safety, and reproducibility.

### 🤝 3. AI Optional and Additive
AI will enhance explanation, not replace the core logic.
The plugin remains the source of truth; AI helps interpret the results.

### 🧘‍♂️ 4. Clarity Over Complexity
Reports prioritize:
- Understandability
- Practical next steps
- Actionable recommendations
- Safe modernization paths

### 🛠 5. Built for Real Teams
AndroidDoctor is designed for:
- Large, legacy apps
- Teams migrating to Compose
- Org-level modernization initiatives
- CI workflows
