# AndroidDoctor CLI (Reporter)

> **Status:** Placeholder — implementation will begin in Phase 1.

This module will contain the **Kotlin-based CLI tool** that reads the `report.json`
generated by the AndroidDoctor Gradle plugin and produces:

- Markdown reports (developer-friendly)
- HTML reports (stakeholder-friendly)
- Future: CI annotations, PR comments, and dashboard exports

The CLI will focus on clear, actionable recommendations that help teams modernize
their Android projects safely and effectively.

No implementation exists yet; this directory serves as part of the initial repo structure.
