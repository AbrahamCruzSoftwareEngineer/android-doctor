# AndroidDoctor Sample Projects

This directory will host sample Android projects used for:

- Testing the Gradle plugin (Collector)
- Demonstrating CLI output (Reporter)
- Verifying behavior across different configurations
- Validating integration with CI systems

Sample projects will be added after the initial skeleton of the plugin and CLI
has been implemented.

For now, this directory serves as a placeholder in the repo structure.
